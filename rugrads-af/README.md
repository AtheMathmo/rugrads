# Auto differentiation wrapper for ArrayFire

This wrapper is in its infancy. Currently it only overloads some basic
functions. The end goal is to have all functions in ArrayFire overloaded so that
anyone can write CPU/GPU programs and have the derivative be automatically
included.

## TODO

- Write more tests
- Add documentation
- Fill in more arrayfire functionality
- Resolve type/dimensionality issues
